Mastering SQL with HR Database Queries!
<br>
As part of my journey to becoming a Data Analyst, I’ve been sharpening my SQL skills by solving 25 real-world HR database queries. These queries focus on data retrieval, data manipulation, and analytics, covering 
<br>
essential topics like employee management, salary analysis, and department-level insights.
<br>
<br>
Here’s a glimpse of the SQL queries I’ve worked on:

<br>
Using JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, UNION) to merge data from multiple tables efficiently.
<br>
Handling NULL values, updating records, and inserting new data into tables.
<br>
Advanced Query Techniques such as counting distinct values and working with complex joins.
